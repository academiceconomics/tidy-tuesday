# Tidy Tuesday for the AED

Tidy Tuesday is a community data science challenge meant for practicing and learning basic data wrangling and visualization. Feel free to work in your most comfortable language, or one you want to learn, but I will be most helpful with R. 

Here is the plan:
1. The data and source article is released on a Tuesday. As a community, members can play with or work with the datasets, post interesting graphs, ask the channel questions, share their code.
2. Later in the week (TBD but probably Saturday) we meet and discuss. I will always have something worked out that we can walk through.

The data is either going to come from the R4DS Tidy Tuesday github repository (https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday) or the academic econ tidy tuesday github repository (). 

I know we have people from different time zones, and I want to make it possible for people to attend the meetings, so if you plan on joining please fill out this form with your available times in EST: https://www.when2meet.com/?14071690-Ny63G.

The way this is structured is that the data challenges and a table of the challenges will be in the `/data` folder, and misc local resources are in the `/resources` folder.

# Getting Set Up

## Setup for R

The recommended workflow for R is using RStudio.

1. Install R from here: [https://cloud.r-project.org/](https://cloud.r-project.org/). On Mac you can also install R using [Homebrew](https://brew.sh/).
2. Install Rstudio from here: https://www.rstudio.com/products/rstudio/download/
3. Change your Rstudio theme because the white theme is BLINDING (Tools -> Global Options -> Appearance)

## Setup for Python 

The easiest way to get Python set up is to use Anaconda, which is a distribution and environment management system for Python. It comes bundled with an IDE and allows you to manage various module configurations on the same computer.

You can download and install Anaconda here: https://www.anaconda.com/products/individual.

## Setup for git

On Linux git will already be installed. You can check if you already have git by going to your command line and typing `git --v`.

If you don't have git installed, you can install it from this website: https://git-scm.com.

## Setup for Stata

Fork over a ridiculous amount of money to StataCorp.

# External Resources

## Learning data science

- [R for Data Science](https://r4ds.had.co.nz/) is a free and fantastic textbook for learning visualization and data wrangling with R
- [Python Data Science Handbook](https://jakevdp.github.io/PythonDataScienceHandbook/) is a free textbook available with Jupyter notebooks and text for learning Python
- [Tidy Text Mining](https://www.tidytextmining.com/) is a free book that serves as a great introduction to text mining with R

## Git Stuff
- [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) is probably the definitive resource for learning git
- [Oh Shit, Git!?!](https://ohshitgit.com/) is a quick reference for fixing tons of common mistakes with git

## Static and Interactive Visualization
- [ggplot2: Elegant Graphics for Data Analysis](https://ggplot2-book.org/) is a great reference for static visualizations with `ggplot2`
- [Mastering Shiny](https://mastering-shiny.org/) is a book that walks through creating interactive web applications using Shiny
- [The written Shiny tutorial](https://shiny.rstudio.com/tutorial/written-tutorial/lesson1/) is my (Brice's) favorite intro resource for Shiny
- [The Plotly book](https://plotly-r.com/) is a great resource for interactive visualization using [plotly](https://plotly.com/)

## Misc
- [The Missing Seemster of your CS Education](https://missing.csail.mit.edu/) is fantastic for learning a lot of practical tools like working with bash, using vim, using git, and more
